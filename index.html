        <h1 class="mb-3">Timothy Nguyen
        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Timothy Nguyen, a business student, and am currently finishing off my first year 
        of college. I am looking forward to open my horizons with opportunities such as Business organizations and
        summer internships. One of my biggest professional achievements was selling out of 2000 talent shows tickets
        for two consecutive years. In my life I value the idea of finding your passions, because once you
        pursue your true passions, you'll be content in what you're doing. This idea goes for anything in life;
        this can be for love, careers, and hobbies.<br><br>

        During my free time I enjoy exercising at a gym so I can maintain my physical health as well as mental.
        In my family, I am closest to my sister who is like my second mother. She taught me many things over my lifetime 
        that I am grateful for. To financially relieve my two hardworking parents I resell items such as shoes, clothings,
        and random items that can be flipped for profit. This ultimately made me more financially independent and become more of 
        an adult.<br><br>

        For my career goals I have big plans to be successful for the future which takes a lot of diligent work. 
        I plan on taking the financial or accounting route in business where I will decide which is best fit through 
        summer internships.To give you a background, I chose the financial route because as a child in my family, I was never taught
        anything about money or of that sort. So I had interests in bceoming financially intelligent to understand money better. 
        Recently I began "Rich Dad Poor Dad," a book that teaches you how to be rich and why the rich get richer. In this book, the idea that struck me the 
        hardest was that many people buy things that are liabilities which means that they return no value to you. So in that case we need to invest in something
        called assets, which is essentially a self-investment in yourself, your business, and etc that can be a stream of income that makes you passive money. This idea 
        made me more driven than I was before to learn about this industry and how it worked. Therefore, those internships that I applied to this summer was supposed to
        give me an introduction of the field that I might be interested in. My thought process is that if what I am doing in the finance or accounting route is something
        I excel and understand, then I will consider it as my career. This isn't my end-all-be-all, because ever since I was in high school, I had 
        a nagging curiosity of what it would be like if I had my own clothing brand or any brand of that sort. So I plan on taking the investments and savings
        from the business "career" I will hopefully obtain in the near-future, and use that capital to kick-start my ideas. I really wanted to either have a 
        simple streetwear brand or a super high quality essentials unisex clothing brand.
